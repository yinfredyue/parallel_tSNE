In this project, we have successfully parallelized the Barnes-Hut t-SNE algorithm using 3 different parallelization approaches: multi-threading with OpenMP, Single Program Multiple Data with ISPC and massive parallelism with CUDA. We achieved significant speedups as compared to the baseline and analyzed the results thoroughly.
